/*
    This class is responsbile for managing the data for SearchViewController.swift. It holds two data sources, a full list and a narrowed down list. The view controller determines which to use based on the count of the filtered list.
 
    Attempting to make this a struct causes the variables, operated on by a mutating function, to cause memory access violations when attempting to read them after the operation is complete.
