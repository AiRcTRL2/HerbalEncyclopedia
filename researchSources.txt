"Annuals - Plants that perform their entire life cycle from seed to flower to seed within a single growing season. All roots, stems and leaves of the plant die annually. Only the dormant seed bridges the gap between one generation and the next.

Perennials - Plants that persist for many growing seasons. Generally the top portion of the plant dies back each winter and regrows the following spring from the same root system (e.g. Purple Coneflower). Many perennial plants do keep their leaves year round and offer attractive borders and groundcover (e.g. Tickseed, Shasta and Ox-Eyed Daisy). NOTE: WHEN STARTING PERENNIAL PLANTS FROM SEED, BLOOMS WILL BE OBSERVED IN EITHER THE SPRING OR SUMMER OF THE SECOND YEAR AND EACH YEAR THEREAFTER (e.g. Ox-Eyed Daisy planted in the spring of 1996 will not bloom until the spring of 1997).

Biennials - Plants which require two years to complete their life cycle. First season growth results in a small rosette of leaves near the soil surface. During the second season's growth stem elongation, flowering and seed formation occur followed by the entire plant's death.

Annual/Perennial - A plant can behave as an annual or a perennial depending on local climatic and geographic growing conditions. In the southern portion of the United States, these plants tend to grow much quicker than in the north due to the warmer weather and extended growing season. For example: a Black-Eyed Susan would behave as an annual if grown in Louisiana; whereas, if grown in Ohio, a Black-Eyed Susan would behave as a perennial."

Deciduous vs Coniferous

The terms “deciduous” and “coniferous” tell us of classifying trees in two aspects which are according to their leaves and the manner of seed production. There are also other ways of classifying trees like by their group of species “hardwood” and “softwood.” Not surprisingly, though, one can also regard an entire forest as either deciduous or coniferous.

Foremost, one can call a tree deciduous when it loses its leaves during some parts or seasons of the year. Trees with leaves falling off particularly during fall and ultimately losing them throughout winter are described as deciduous. Although they no longer have leaves during the wintertime, these trees are still very much alive. “Deciduous” is actually taken from a Latin term which means “to fall.”

Aside from the typical falling off of the leaves, deciduous trees possess leaves that somewhat transform into another color. During fall, most of their leaves turn reddish, yellowish, or slightly orange. It is also important to note that the majority of deciduous trees also happen to be classified as hardwood. This classification does not directly imply that the wood is hard, although deciduous trees really tend to be much harder than coniferous trees (softwood). Examples of deciduous trees are the fruit trees, oak, nut, and maples.

Coniferous trees are described as such, not by their leaves falling off during fall or winter, but by their seed-bearing natures. These trees bear seeds in structures known as cones. They are, therefore, regarded as gymnosperms (having naked seeds) as opposed to flowering plants (angiosperms). Moreover, most coniferous trees abound in colder climate regions.

The complete opposite of a deciduous tree is not coniferous but is called the evergreen trees whose green leaves, called needles, remain intact for the entire year. A good example of an evergreen tree is the pine. At the same time, pine trees are growing cones as well so they are coniferous. Others incorrectly regard coniferous trees as the exact opposite of deciduous. However, since most conifers are evergreens, this way of thinking is still accepted.

One probable reason why some are confused with these two tree classifications is because of the presence of deciduous conifer trees which appear to be the trees that fall under both categories.
